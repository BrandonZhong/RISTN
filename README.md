# Residual Invertible Spatio-Temporal Network (RISTN) For Video Super-Resolution.

AAAI-2019 poster, we provide code and model architecture for testing. But the code is not polished yet.

## The architecture of our network:

## Dependence:

python 2.7

scikit-image 0.12.0

pytorch 0.4.0

torchvision 0.2.0

model file: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1DNvFwdjmpfzm-ZrCqID9Sw   extrat code: aky3

The directory "Vid4Result" is our output results for Vid4 dataset. you also can run: python Testout2.py for testing.
